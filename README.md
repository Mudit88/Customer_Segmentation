# Customer_Segmentation
### Project Overview:
This project focuses on customer segmentation of a mall's visitors using the K-Means clustering algorithm. The goal is to group customers with similar characteristics together, allowing the mall to tailor marketing strategies and enhance the overall shopping experience. The project involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the data and identify patterns, followed by the application of the Elbow Method to determine the optimum number of clusters for K-Means.

### Data Source:
The data used for this project consists of mall visitors' demographic and behavioral information. It was obtained from the mall's customer database and contains features such as age, gender, annual income, and spending score.

### Project Steps:

Data Collection:

Gathered the customer data from the mall's database, ensuring it is appropriately anonymized and complies with privacy regulations.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Performed EDA to understand the data distribution, identify missing values, and gain insights into customer demographics.
Visualized features such as age, annual income, and spending score using histograms, box plots, and scatter plots.
Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values, outliers, and any other data quality issues identified during EDA.
Standardized or normalized the data to ensure all features have the same scale, which is essential for K-Means.
Applying the Elbow Method:

Implemented the K-Means algorithm for different values of k (number of clusters).
Utilized the Elbow Method to identify the optimum number of clusters that best explain the variance in the data.
Performing K-Means Clustering:

Selected the optimum number of clusters determined from the Elbow Method.
Applied the K-Means algorithm to segment the customers into different groups based on their attributes.
Customer Segmentation Analysis:

Analyzed the characteristics of each customer segment to understand their behaviors and preferences.
Generated visualizations to present the distinct groups of customers effectively.

### Conclusion:
The customer segmentation of mall visitors using K-Means provides valuable insights into customer groups, enabling the mall to optimize marketing strategies and enhance the shopping experience. By utilizing this data-driven approach, the mall can make informed decisions to attract and retain customers, leading to increased customer satisfaction and overall profitability.
